The calculator supports the following operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Sine (sin)
Cosine (cos)
Tangent (tan)
Square root (sqrt)
Power (^)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To compile and run this program, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as g++.

Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command in your terminal:

sh
Copy code
g++ -o calculator calcu.c++
Running the Program
After compiling, you can run the program using the following command:

sh
Copy code
./calculator
Usage
The program will prompt you to enter a number, an operation, and another number if needed. The result will be displayed after each operation. For example:

Addition

arduino
Copy code
Enter a number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /, sin, cos, tan, sqrt, ^): +
Enter another number: 3
Result: 8
Sine

c
Copy code
Enter a number: 0.5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /, sin, cos, tan, sqrt, ^): sin
Result: 0.479426
